I haven't been commiting for about a week now, and I have honestly been overwhelmed. If I don't get points for it thats fine I know the consequiences, I just wanted to let you know whats going on so we are on the same page. As a your student I don't want you to make immediate assumptions, ecpecially since I am hoping to get into this program and may end up taking more of your classes.
So whats been going on. I was asked to come into work on a day I had class. I thought it was no big deal, the classes were recorded. Well work is exhausting and I should note that I have a very hard time with homework,  even though in class work is completely fine. So next thing I know its the next week and I haven't caught up on those 2 classes I missed. Well I don't want to watch the next class until I get those done so I don't watch them as well. This started to keep building up until now as well as a lot of bigger projects for other classes and I became overwhelmed. I didn't want to sit down and do any of it.
I fall into these self traps all the time and its hard to work through. Finally yesterday I started getting caught up and hopefully should by tomorrow. Sometimes I have to sit down and tell myself to just do one class for an hour, instead of thinking of the 6+ hours of class I now have to catch up on.
So this is just in case you were wondering why I just dropped off. No need to reply or give me points I didn't earn. This is jsut information for you, take it as you will.
